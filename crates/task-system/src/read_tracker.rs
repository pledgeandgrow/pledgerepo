// Read tracker — automatic file-read dependency tracking.
//
// PledgePack uses explicit dependencies (Task<T> arguments) as its primary
// dependency tracking mechanism. This is safer and more deterministic than
// Turbopack's read interception. However, there are cases where a task
// reads files that aren't declared as explicit dependencies — for example,
// a transform task might read a `tsconfig.json` or `.browserslistrc` file
// that affects its output but isn't passed as a `Task<T>` argument.
//
// The `ReadTracker` supplements explicit dependencies:
//   1. Before task execution, a `ReadTracker` is installed in a thread-local.
//   2. File I/O functions (or wrappers) call `ReadTracker::record_read()`.
//   3. After task execution, the recorded reads are merged with explicit
//      dependencies and stored in `StoredOutput`.
//   4. When any recorded file changes, the task is invalidated.
//
// This is NOT a replacement for explicit dependencies — it's a safety net
// for implicit dependencies that would otherwise cause stale cache hits.
//
// # Design Trade-offs
//
// - Thread-local, not global: each task execution gets its own tracker.
// - Zero overhead when disabled: `record_read()` checks a thread-local bool.
// - Deterministic: the same task reading the same files always produces the
//   same dependency set. No non-determinism from filesystem state.
// - Opt-in: tasks that don't do file I/O pay no cost.
