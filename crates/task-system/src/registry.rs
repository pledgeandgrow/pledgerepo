// Task registry — maps TaskId → executor function.
//
// The registry is the bridge between the `#[task]` macro and the engine.
// When the macro generates a task function, it registers an executor that:
//   1. Reads all input Task<T> values (recursively computing them if needed)
//   2. Calls the user's function body
//   3. Wraps the result in a StoredOutput with dependency edges
//
// The registry is NOT a global singleton — it's owned by the TaskEngine.
// This avoids the global mutable state problems that turbo-tasks has with
// its `Lazy::new` registration pattern.
